This is a database I made for the **LUT University** *Basics of Database Systems (2024)* course. The course
lasted from early January to late February. As the name suggests, I learned the basic elements of relational
database systems, such as the creation and manipulation of databases with **SQLite**. This database project
was evaluated and given the maximum amount of points (50/50), as all the set criteria were met.
